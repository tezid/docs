# TezID Documentation

TezID consist of 3 components;

* [The Smart Contracts](https://github.com/tezid/contracts)
* [The Dapp](https://tezid.net)
* [The Oracle API](https://tezid.net)

## The Smart Contracts

The TezID Smart Contracts are implemented in [SmartPy](https://smartpy.io/) and available as FOSS software [here](https://github.com/tezid/contracts).

There are two main contracts; the *controller* and the *store*.

### Controller

The controller is responsible for the logic interacting with TezID proofs. Limiting who and what proofs can be registered, cost, verifications, renewals etc. 

## Store

The store is responsible for holding the proof data. It also has available *views* and *entrypoints* for integration purposes.

## Entrypoints and view

Entrypoints and views for the TezID smart contracts is documented in the [contracts](https://github.com/tezid/contracts) repo.
